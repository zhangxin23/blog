RestTemplate

The RestTemplate takes care of the necessary plumbing needed to communicate with REST services and automatically marshals/unmarshals HTTP request and response bodies. The RestTemplate like Spring’s other popular helper classes such as JdbcTemplate and JmsTemplate, is based on the Template Method design pattern.1
The RestTemplate and associated utility classes are part of the spring-web.jar file. If you are building a standalone REST client using RestTemplate, you need to add the spring-web dependency.
